# Take Home Project Directions
## General Instructions
This exercise is to help us determine your ability to write quality, self-documenting code, pay attention to edge cases, and follow requirements. Your recruiter will let you know the deadline to submit your project from when we provide you access to this repository. It also checks your ability to use Git...
	
Clone this (mostly) empty repository
1. Create a branch with the pattern AUS_FirstName_LastName
2. Write your project!
3. Be sure to squash commits if you have more than 1 commit to your local branch.
4. When finished create a pull request against the master branch, do not merge. Send your recruiter the link to your PR. Your recruiter must receive the link no more than 1 week after you have been given access to the repo.

## Automation Project
### Part 1: Build tests
Please use this [Automation Testing Site](https://automationexercise.com/) for this assessment.

1. Select two or three features
2. Create test cases for testing those features
3. Cover those test cases by autotests
4. Implement opportunity to generate nice report for test results

Bonus point if your testing includes Backend tests, such as API testing, load testing, data quality testing.

### Part 2: Discussion
Add a brief description of the choices you made when building these tests. For example,
1. Why did you create test cases according to BDD (or not)?
2. Why did you select the Test Management tool you chose?
3. Why did you select the Report Generation tool you chose?
